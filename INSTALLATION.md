# Installation instructions for DisVis

This document shows how to prepare your system for GPU accelerated DisVis for
MacOSX, using the OpenCL framework.  Note though, that it requires a high-end
graphics card to get a proper acceleration, else the speedup will be neglible.
Practically this means that it should be either an AMD or NVIDIA GPU; if it is
a power efficient Intel card, usually present on laptops, installing the GPU
version will most likely not help much. 

## Requirements

* An OpenCL1.1+ enabled GPU (this is for current Macs usually the case)
* brew (MacOSX package manager)
* git
* pip

First install Python bindings to OpenCL with the pyopencl Python package

    pip install --upgrade pyopencl

Note that this will upgrade all dependencies required for pyopencl, such as
NumPy.

Next comes the somewhat more tedious part of installing a high-performance FFT
library for GPU using the OpenCL framework clFFT. This requires the cmake
program first

    brew install cmake

Next download the source code of clFFT and build the library

    git clone https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT.git
    cd clFFT/src && cmake CMakeLists.txt && make && cd ../../

Python bindings to to the clFFT library are provided with the gpyfft package

    git clone https://github.com/geggo/gpyfft.git
    cd gpyfft

In the folder of gpyfft there is a file called setup.py. Open it with a text
editor and change the directory that points to the clFFT directory. Then type

    sudo python setup.py install

If it all worked out, congratulations, your system is now ready for GPU
calculations!
